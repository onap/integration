      "message": "I just wonder if you need to put such configuration here as it should be already available in a clouds.yaml file that should be able to get. So an \"official\" yaml could be used as a complement to your config.\nIt would avoid data duplcation (I do not like config duplication.. :)).\nBut it means that in the rest of the code you need to retrieve the data from this clouds.yaml (e.g. with shade) and from this config\nIt is up to you.",

Considering shade to be looking for clouds.yaml first in local dir and only then in ~/.config/openstack I can change the scripts to be using shade library for the OS credentials gathering but will need to elaborate whether search order can be reversed.\n\nWill raise a separate ticket for that matter, let\u0027s please accept this one and merge whole topic, will work on top of it.",
