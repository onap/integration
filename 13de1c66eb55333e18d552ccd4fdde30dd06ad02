      "message": "I don\u0027t think we can define python3.7 explicitly - CI minions are on Xenial with Python3.5 so tox would fail with a bang unfortunately.\n\nAs for python2.7 code - if I\u0027m not mistaken all vcpe scripts are Python2 so we don\u0027t want to remove that for sure. As for the rest - as you could see I did many fixes in scripts (actual fixes or added pylint check disable directives) recently to pass the validation. Now there\u0027s only a few scripts left with some  issues and i think once anyone makes a change to them and the CI verify job will fail on linter that\u0027ll be best impulse to refactor it to python3 to have it merged for the commit author:)",
