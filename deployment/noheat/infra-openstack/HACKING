 Development environment
=========================

This environment focuses on interactions with OpenStack (here: DevStack) instance. Changes can be
made from host machine but additional guest ("operator") is provided for developers' convenience.

Environment on "operator" machine is already set up and can be accessed by:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ vagrant ssh operator

Provided ``clouds.yaml`` file differs slightly from the one that can be obtained with following
steps:

#. Open OpenStack dashboard (http://localhost:8080 forwarded from "devstack" machine)
#. Navigate to ``Project``, then ``API Access`` on the left panel
#. Select ``Download OpenStack RC File``, then ``OpenStack clouds.yaml File`` on the right side

Summary of changes:

- Added password from ``local.conf`` file (used in DevStack instance setup)
- Removed ``project_id`` which might change on a new DevStack instance
- Replaced ``auth_url`` based on machine's dynamic IP with the static private address

Installed Python package ``python-openstackclient`` includes key package ``openstacksdk`` as
a dependency and provides additional CLI tools. Tool ``pip`` for Python 3 was used for installing
these packages.
