/**
 * @defgroup cl Client Library
 * @{
 *
 * @brief Provides the public API towards applications using sysrepo to store
 * their configuration data, or towards management agents.
 *
 * Communicates with Sysrepo Engine (@ref cm), which is running either inside
 * of dedicated sysrepo daemon, or within this library if daemon is not alive.
 *
 * Access to the sysrepo datastore is connection- and session- oriented. Before
 * calling any data access/manipulation API, one needs to connect to the datastore
 * via ::sr_connect and open a session via ::sr_session_start. One connection
 * can serve multiple sessions.
 *
 * Each data access/manipulation request call is blocking - blocks the connection
 * until the response from Sysrepo Engine comes, or until an error occurs. It is
 * safe to call multiple requests on the same session (or different session that
 * belongs to the same connection) from multiple threads at the same time,
 * however it is not effective, since each call is blocked until previous one
 * finishes. If you need fast multi-threaded access to sysrepo, use a dedicated
 * connection for each thread.
 *
 * @see
 * See @ref main_page "Sysrepo Introduction" for details about sysrepo architecture.
 * @see
 * @ref xp_page "XPath Addressing" is used for node identification in data-related calls.
