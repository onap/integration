## Guide for hpa_automation.py script in tosca

These guide describes how to run the hpa_automation.py script. It can be used to run the vCPE end to end
use cases.

## Prerequisites

 - Login in your CLI container.
 - Install python mysql.connector in CLI container (pip install --no-cache-dir mysql-connector-python)
 - Create Nodeport for Policy pdp using the pdp_service_expose.yaml file (copy pdp_service_expose.yaml
   in hpa_automation/tosca to rancher and run kubectl apply -f pdp_expose.yaml)
 - Design vCPE in SDC, you can refer to https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/vCPE+with+Tosca+VNF+Test+Guide.
 - Put in the CSAR file to be used to create service models and specify its path in vcpe_config.json
 - Put in the right parameters for automation in vcpe_config.json or vcpe_vgw_config.json
   you must change below params:
   - aai_url: https://<node-ip>:30233
   - sdc_onboarding_url: http://<cluster-ip>:8081
     <cludster-ip> can be gotten by "kubectl get services -n onap -o wide | grep sdc-onboarding-be"
   - sdc_catalog_url: http://<node-ip>:30205
   - multicloud_url: http://<node-ip>:30280
   - policy_url: https://<node-ip>:30694
   - vfc-url: http://<node-ip>:30280
   - cloud_region_data
   - vnfs path
   - ns path
 - You can run the following commands.
   vcpe_config.json including all vnfs.
   vcpe_vgw_config.json including vgw vnf, we can use it to test VF-C and do simple integration test.
   - Use local package which is submitted by local file system.
     # python hpa_automation.py -f vcpe_vgw_config.json -t "local"
   - Use sdc package which is distributed from SDC.
     # python hpa_automation.py -f vcpe_config.json -t "sdc"

**Points to Note:**
 - The hpa_automation.py runs end to end. It does the following;
   - Create cloud complex
   - Register cloud regions
   - Create service type
   - Create customer and adds customer subscription
   - SDC Onboarding (Create VLM, VSP, VF Model, and service model)
   - Upload policy models and adds policies
   - Create Service Instance and VNF Instance
 - There are well named functions that do the above items every time the script is run. If you do not
   wish to run any part of that, you can go into the script and comment out the section at the bottom
   that handles that portion.
