# ONAP on Vagrant

This vagrant project pretends to collect information about a way to deploy
and build [ONAP project](https://www.onap.org/) into a development environment.

### Problem Being Solved

* Reduce the barrier of entry to allow new ONAP developers to ramp up on to
active development quickly
* Reduce the cost to the community in responding to simple environment setup
questions faced by new developers
