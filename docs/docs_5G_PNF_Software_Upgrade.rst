LCM evolution with API Decision Tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A decision point has been introduced in the Frankfurt release. The service designer needs to indicate which LCM API they would like to use for the LCM operations on the selected PNF source at design time (via SDC). The possible LCM APIs are: SO-REF-DATA (default), CDS, SDNC, or APPC.
