ONAP Maturity Testing Notes
---------------------------

For El Alto release, ONAP continues to improve in multiple areas of
Scalability, Security, Stability and Performance (S3P) metrics.

In addition of the windriver lab, Master and El Alto use cases have been tested
on Ericcson (Daily Master CI chain), Orange (Daily Master chain, Gating) and
windriver labs (use cases, daily, long duration). See `Integration Lab portal
<http://testresults.opnfv.org/onap-integration>`


A gating chain has been setup for OOM. This CI chain provides feedback to the
integration team. For each OOM change, a full ONAP deployment is triggered then
several tests are executed (k8s verification, helm chart verification, 61 robot
healthcheck, healthdist and end to end basic VNF tests).
For El Alto, more than 1000 pipelines have been executed (gating, daily master
and stable).
The results of the tests for the OOM gating can be found ` here
<https://orange-opensource.gitlab.io/lfn/onap/xtesting-onap-view/index.html>`

Tests dealing with more than 25 test cases are executed on Windriver
environment.

The Integration team ran the 72 hours stability testing (xx% passing rate) and
full resilience testing (xx% passing rate) at ONAP OpenLabs.
