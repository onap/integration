Change Management Schedule Optimization 
-------------------------------------------------------------

Description 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The change management schedule optimizer automatically identifies a conflict-free schedule for executing changes across multiple network function instances. It takes into account constraints such as concurrency limits (how many instances can be executed simultaneously), time preferences (e.g., night time maintenance windows with low traffic volumes) and applies optimization techniques to generate schedules.
