Change Management Schedule Optimization
---------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The change management schedule optimizer automatically identifies a conflict-free
schedule for executing changes across multiple network function instances.
It takes into account constraints such as concurrency limits (how many instances
can be executed simultaneously), time preferences (e.g., night time maintenance
windows with low traffic volumes) and applies optimization techniques to
generate schedules.
