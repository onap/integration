vCPE Use Case
-------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
vCPE use case is based on Network Enhanced Residential Gateway architecture
specified in Technical Report 317 (TR-317), which defines how service
providers deploy residential broadband services like High Speed Internet
Access. The use case implementation has infrastructure services and customer
service. The common infrastructure services are deployed first and shared by
all customers. The use case demonstrates ONAP capabilities to design, deploy,
configure and control sophisticated services.

More details on the vCPE Use Case can be found on `wiki page <https://wiki.onap.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3246168>`_

Source Code
~~~~~~~~~~~
`vcpe test scripts <https://gerrit.onap.org/r/gitweb?p=integration.git;a=tree;f=test/vcpe;h=76572f4912e7b375e1e4d0177a0e50a61691dc4a;hb=refs/heads/casablanca>`_

How to Use
~~~~~~~~~~
Most part of the use case has been automated by vcpe scripts. For the details on how to run the scripts, please refer to the `use case tutorial on wiki page <https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/vCPE+Use+Case+Tutorial%3A+Design+and+Deploy+based+on+ONAP>`_

Test Status
~~~~~~~~~~~
The use case has been tested for Casablanca release, the test report can be
found on `test status wiki page <https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/vCPE+-+Test+Status>`_

Known Issues and Workaround
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Firewalls are installed on BRG and vBNG. In order to allow SDNC to send BRG
   configuration message through vBNG, SDNC host VM IP address is preloaded on
   BRG and vBNG, and provisioned into the firewalls. If SDNC changes its host
   VM, SDNC host VM IP changes and we need to manually update the IP in
   /opt/config/sdnc_ip.txt. Then run:

::

  root>vppctl tap delete tap-0
  root>vppctl tap delete tap-1
  root>/opt/nat_service.sh
  root>vppctl restart

2) APPC has a bug which prevents DG from reading AAI info. We needs an DG
   update. See the JIRA on https://jira.onap.org/browse/APPC-1249

3) In closed loop, APPC fails to send response back to Policy via an DMAAP
   message. Policy will keep sending reboot action request until timed out or
   ABATED message is received. User may see 3 or 4 vGMUX reboots before service
   returns normal. See the JIRA on https://jira.onap.org/browse/APPC-1247
