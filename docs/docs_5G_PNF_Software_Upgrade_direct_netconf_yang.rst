PNF Software Upgrade Scenario: Using Direct Netconf/Yang interface with PNF
===========================================================================
Software Upgrade Procedure
------------------------------------

With this scenario, the pre-conditions are:

* SO PNF software upgrade workflows are ready to use
* An SDC service template with one PNF resource has been designed (including CBA association) and has been distributed
* Service instantiation is completed, including PNF PnP. meaning a PNF instance is in operation with connectivity between PNF-ONAP, PNF-SFTP
* At design time, the CONTROLLER_ACTOR is set for CDS client for the API selection decision
* PNF has direct NETCONF/YANG interface configured which can be reachable from ONAP controller.

At run time, the PNF in-place software upgrade procedure is triggered when the operator provides the selected PNF software upgrade workflow, a PNF instance, and the target software version using VID GUI or CLI.
Then the software upgrade workflow is executed in SO:

a. SO sends CDS request(s) with action-identifier {actionName, blueprintName, blueprintVersion} to the blueprint processor inside the controller using CDS self-service API
b. Controller/blueprint processor executes the blueprint scripts including sending NETCONF request(s) to the PNF instance via the direct NETCONF interface.
c. Repeat above two steps for each SO building blocks.
